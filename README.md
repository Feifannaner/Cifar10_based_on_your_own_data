# Cifar10_based_on_your_own_data
Here I  collect my own data including ten different gestures, and I want to train them using the famous cifar10. Here are some programs about the collecting data sets and generate the responding binary data in batches for the input of the NET.
The steps are as follows:
* Colect your own data in 10 diretories, and each has 6000 png files.such as dog-1.png
* Randomly to constuct the training batches files and test files.
* Convert the batch files to Binary files 
* modify the Net in path and train your NET
